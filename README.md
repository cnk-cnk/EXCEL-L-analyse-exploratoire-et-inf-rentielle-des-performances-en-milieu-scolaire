The dataset is from KAGGLE, named StudentsPerformance. We consider the dataset to be a sample from a population and carry on descriptive and Inferential statistics.

Dashboard of students' performance
1) Students' grade (A, B, C, D, E, F) in each subject
2) Total average score for each subject
3) Scores' distribution in each subject
4) Performance by men and women in each subject
5) Parents' educational level influence on students' scores
6) Test preparation influence on students' scores
7) Lunch influence on students' scores

Inferential statistics on students performance based on observations from the Dashboard
1) Test for normality of the data to see which statistics to carry on the data for our  analysis
    ---  QQ plot"
2) Infer about population parameters such as proportions of  male & female, overall mean score in each subject : 
    --- Confidence interval, T critical value, standard error"
3) Test if our data gender proportion follows the 40 - 60  expected gender ratio
  -- Chi square test"
4) Hypothesis testing to see if there is a statistical significant differences in the different subjects
    --- TWO -WAY ANOVA without replication"
5) Hypothesis testing to see if there is a statistical significant differences in Math, Reading and Writing for male and female 
    --- TWO -WAY ANOVA without replication"
6) Hypothesis testing to confirm whether or not males do better in maths than females and the other way round
   ---  Independent T-test"
7) Hypothesis testing to confirm or not that students with parents having a master degree tend to do better than the rest 
    --- TWO WAY ANOVA with replication ( Unbalanced design) & Post Hoc test (Tukey)"
